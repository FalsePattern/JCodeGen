# JCodeGen

A simple-to-use code generation library for java, intended for generating code with the help of an already running JVM.

### Warning - Not yet production ready. Only use for experimentation!

## Notice on generated code
The generated code is owned by whoever wrote the instructions that invoke this library to generate said code.

Generated code has no implied license, so any arbitrary license may be applied to them,
but I would prefer if you kept the comment at the top of files generated by this library.
